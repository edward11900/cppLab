/* Basic Properties of Arrays:
    1) The elements are stored continuously in the memory.

    2) All of the elements in an array are of the same type.

    3) The elements are accessed using a 0-based index system.

    (address of arr[i]) = (address arr begins) + i.(Size of each element in arr)

   Static array syntax:
    1) Array's physical size must be a constant and must be given at declaration.

    2) Array's name is a legal C++ expression.
    It's value is the address in the memory where the array starts.

    3) Initialization of array (at declaration)
